Hey there! I'm a fullstack developer who's totally into coding and loves exploring the latest tech stuff. I'm all about rocking NodeJS, Flutter, Firebase, MongoDB, and more awesome technologies. When I'm not geeking out with code, you'll find me chowing down on delicious food and satisfying my wanderlust with some epic travel adventures. My dream? Landing a gig at one of those super cool tech spaces. I'm all about connecting with new folks, so hit me up if you want to chat about tech!
